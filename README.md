# **Hackathon - 3rd Place**

## Overview

This project was developed for a hackathon, where our team secured the 3rd place. The application aims to provide users with pollen forecasts for their city for the next three days. Predictions are generated using various models, and the application is monetized through advertisements.

## Business Idea

The application serves as a useful tool for individuals who are affected by pollen allergies. It provides accurate and timely predictions about pollen levels, allowing users to manage their symptoms effectively.

### Features

- **Pollen Forecasting:** Predicts pollen levels for the next three days in the user's city using multiple models.
- **Location-Based Predictions:** Provides forecasts specific to the user's city.
- **Ad-Supported:** Generates revenue through ads displayed within the app.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection:** Collects pollen data and other relevant information required for predictions.
2. **Model Training:** Utilizes various models to generate accurate pollen forecasts.
3. **User Interface:** Displays the forecasts in an easy-to-understand format.
4. **Monetization:** Incorporates advertisements to generate revenue.
